DWM
===========

**Personal DWM patches, diffed against stock DWM.**

* `gapsbetween`: Like `uselessgap` but only between tiled windows.
* `autostartlite`: Specify an autostart script directly in `config.h`. Kinda
  stupid since it bloats the binary.
* `ICSfocusline`: Draws an ICS-like focus indicator on the root window,
  vertically. Needs some sort of gap between windows and may conflict with borders.
* `centertags`: Custom bar layout, puts tags on center.
* `centerstatus`: Essentially the same, but with the status text on center.
* `toppadding`: Adds a gap between the bar and tiled windows.
* `togglelayout`: Setting a layout twice will toggle it back to the previous one.
* `custom`: Personal setup.
